# ESP8266-API-Flooder


A lightweight API stress testing tool using ESP8266, capable of sending high-speed login requests to any specified endpoint.

## Features
- Rapid API request flooder for login stress testing
- Set target API dynamically via Serial Monitor
- Modify login credentials easily (default: `test1` / `test2`)
- Start and stop attacks with Serial commands
- Overheating protection to prevent hardware damage

## Usage

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Flash the Code to ESP8266
Upload the `ESP8266-API-Flooder.ino` file to your ESP8266 board.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set the Target API
Open Serial Monitor and enter:
```
url https://yourapi.com/login
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Flood
```
start
```
ESP8266 will begin sending requests rapidly.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Stop the Flood
```
stop
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Change Login Credentials
Modify the code in `sendFloodRequest()` to set custom username & password.
Alternatively, you can update the credentials dynamically via Serial Monitor in a future update.
